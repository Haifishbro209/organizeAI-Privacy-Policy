        <h2>13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION FOR DATA BREACHES OR SECURITY INCIDENTS</h2>
        <p>13.1 Acknowledgment of Security Risks and Limitations

By using the Services offered by OrganizeAI, you expressly acknowledge and understand that, despite our extensive and ongoing efforts to implement advanced and industry-standard security protocols, practices, and technologies, the inherent nature of digital technologies, Internet infrastructure, and online environments exposes data to potential vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include, but are not limited to, data breaches, hacking attempts, unauthorized access by third parties, malicious cyberattacks, software flaws, physical breaches of data centers, employee negligence, or even unforeseen events like natural disasters or government interference. As such, while we take significant steps to secure Personal Data and User Content, we do not guarantee and cannot promise that your data will be 100% secure under all circumstances.

13.2 No Absolute Security Guarantee and Assumption of Risk

You acknowledge and agree that OrganizeAI cannot and does not warrant the security, confidentiality, or integrity of any Personal Data, User Content, or other information transmitted to or from our Services. You also understand that there are certain risks in any online service or system, and by using the Services, you expressly assume full responsibility and risk associated with those activities. This includes the risk of unauthorized access, disclosure, destruction, or alteration of your Personal Data, and any potential misuse, loss, or destruction of your data that could result from a breach of security, even if such a breach occurs due to a failure of our security infrastructure, or an attack from third-party cybercriminals, hackers, or other malicious actors.

13.3 Exclusion of Liability for Data Breaches and Security Incidents

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, OrganizeAI, including its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, or any third-party service providers engaged by OrganizeAI, shall not be held liable or responsible for any direct, indirect, special, consequential, incidental, or punitive damages, or any loss of profit, revenue, business opportunity, or goodwill arising from or related to: (a) any unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of Personal Data or User Content, whether resulting from cyberattacks, malware, hacking incidents, or any other form of breach, irrespective of whether the breach was foreseeable or preventable; (b) any failure, interruption, or disruption in the functioning or availability of our Services, including, but not limited to, failures caused by infrastructure issues, server outages, or failures on the part of third-party service providers or collaborators; (c) any failure to maintain the confidentiality or security of information transmitted by or to you through our Services, including vulnerabilities in your devices, software, or networks; (d) the negligent or willful actions of any unauthorized third party or any misuse, theft, or exploitation of the Services or data by third parties who gain access to your data through no fault of OrganizeAI.

13.4 Indemnification and Defense

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless OrganizeAI, its directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, subsidiaries, contractors, and third-party service providers from and against any and all claims, lawsuits, actions, demands, losses, damages, liabilities, or expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable legal fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with: (a) your use or misuse of our Services or any breach of your obligations under this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service; (b) any actions or omissions that result in security vulnerabilities, breaches, or loss of data due to your failure to adhere to recommended security practices, such as using weak passwords, sharing login credentials, or not updating security settings; (c) any direct or indirect consequences of a security breach that leads to the exposure or loss of your Personal Data, account information, or other sensitive content, where such breach occurs outside the reasonable control of OrganizeAI; (d) any claims or demands from third parties resulting from your use of the Services or your failure to comply with applicable data protection regulations.

13.5 Acknowledgment of Security Breach Notification and Mitigation Efforts

In the event that a data breach or security incident occurs, OrganizeAI shall make reasonable efforts to: (a) notify affected Users as quickly as possible in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, (b) mitigate potential harm or risks resulting from such incidents, and (c) address the underlying cause of the breach. However, OrganizeAI cannot guarantee the complete prevention of future security incidents or breaches. Any such notification and mitigation efforts shall not be construed as an admission of liability by OrganizeAI, nor shall they limit the scope of the indemnity provided under this section.

13.6 Third-Party Services, Security, and Liability Limitations

Our Services may contain links to third-party websites, tools, or integrations that are not under the control of OrganizeAI. These third parties may have different data security practices, policies, and privacy measures, which may be subject to their respective terms and conditions. OrganizeAI does not control and is not responsible for the security practices, privacy policies, or content of these third-party services, websites, or applications. You understand that any information, including Personal Data, that you choose to share with third-party services, or that is collected by them through their own platforms, is outside of OrganizeAI’s control. Accordingly, we disclaim any liability for security incidents, data breaches, or other unauthorized access that may occur on any third-party platform, and you agree to indemnify OrganizeAI for any claims arising from such interactions with third-party services.

13.7 No Warranties on Service Availability or Security

You further acknowledge that, although we take commercially reasonable measures to ensure the continuous availability and security of our Services, we make no warranties, express or implied, regarding the performance, availability, or security of the Services. OrganizeAI does not guarantee that the Services will be free from errors, bugs, viruses, interruptions, or failures that may affect the functionality or performance of the Services. You agree that your use of the Services is at your own risk and that the Company does not warrant uninterrupted, error-free, or secure operation of its systems, servers, or network. In particular, you acknowledge that we cannot guarantee that data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, and we make no representations regarding the effectiveness of our security measures in preventing cyberattacks, data loss, or unauthorized access.

13.8 Limitation of Liability for Security Failures and Incidents

In the event of a data breach or security failure that involves the unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss of your Personal Data, OrganizeAI’s liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and shall not exceed the total amount paid by you for the use of our Services in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the breach or failure. This limitation of liability shall apply regardless of the nature of the breach or security incident, and regardless of whether such breach is caused by negligence, willful misconduct, or external factors beyond our control.

13.9 Future Security Measures and Evolving Threats

As the digital landscape evolves, so too does the nature of threats and vulnerabilities. OrganizeAI commits to continuously updating and enhancing its security protocols in response to emerging threats and evolving technological standards. However, you acknowledge and understand that no system can be entirely immune to attacks or breaches, and that it is impossible to guarantee 100% security at all times. You agree to hold OrganizeAI harmless for any damage, data loss, or harm caused by new or unforeseen vulnerabilities, whether or not they were within our control or could have been mitigated with existing security measures.
